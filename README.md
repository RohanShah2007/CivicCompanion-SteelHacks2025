# CivicCompanion-SteelHacks2025
### This is my project for SteelHacks 2025. This project follows the civic accessibility and healthcare optimization tracks.

  Civic Companion is a chatbot that utilizes the Gemini Api to help patients who are unfamiliar with the healthcare system in the United States to make informed decisions regarding their treatment based on their symptoms. 
  The chatbot will grade the patients symptoms on severity level and give the patient reccomended steps to recive treatment. The reccomendations the chatbot will give will tell the patient about where they should get care, how insurance works, necessary documents the patient needs, and paperwork they need to fill out. There are further resouces on a sidbar menu next to the chatbox which will direct the patient to the nearest place of care the chatbot reccomends, a first aid guide, medication safety, emergency contacts, and mental health resouces. 
  Note: the chatbot does not diagnose but only make reccomendations for the patient's next steps. All information including next steps, insurance, and patient rights is based on the information found in healthcare.gov and state.gov.
